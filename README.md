# UnchopeMakan

As an extension of the physical starter swaps performed over the [Bank](http://github.com/foodguthub/Bank), we also have an online [UnchopeMakan map](http://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=zCoDc3SSi24I.korG11Dfhm4A) listing places where Singapore locals offer to share their starters. In Singlish, "chope" = reserving/not sharing table in food court; "makan" = Malay for eating.

The Map runs on the Google Maps platform and is open to public editing: anyone can add a pin to mark a starter sharing location.
