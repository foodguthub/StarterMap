# UnchopeMakan

The [UnchopeMakan map](http://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=zCoDc3SSi24I.korG11Dfhm4A) is an online listing of places where Singapore locals offer to share their starters. In Singlish, "chope" means reserving/not sharing table in food court; "makan" is a Malay word for eating. 

The Map runs on the Google Maps platform and is open to public editing: anyone can add a pin to mark a starter sharing location. Use it as an extension of the [Fermentation Bank](http://github.com/foodguthub/Bank).
